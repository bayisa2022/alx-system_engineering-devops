A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Requirements:

This should be transparent to the user
HAproxy should return a 301
HAproxy should redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg)
